An attempt to imitate a Scala solution in Java 8
The goal was to use as much java 8 features as possible,
to get some routine in using these features,
and also to try to keep the program as short
as possible.

Well, that last thing didn't work, this version
is three times as long as the scala version.

Still, nice try, I'd say.
